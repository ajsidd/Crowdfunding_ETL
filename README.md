# Crowdfunding_ETL
# Crowdfunding ETL Project

Welcome to the Crowdfunding ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project! This project focuses on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform data from Excel files. After transforming the data, you'll create CSV files, design a database schema, create a PostgreSQL database, and import the data into the database.

## Project Overview

In this mini-project, you will work with a partner to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Create the Campaign DataFrame
3. Create the Contacts DataFrame
4. Create the Crowdfunding Database

## Getting Started

### Files

Download the starter code and files from [Project 2 ETL files](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m13/lms/starter/Starter_Files.zip).

### Instructions

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the project deliverables. Make sure to collaborate effectively with your partner and maintain communication throughout the project.

## Deliverables

### 1. Category DataFrame

- Create a DataFrame with sequential category IDs and category titles.
- Export the DataFrame as `category.csv`.

### 2. Subcategory DataFrame

- Create a DataFrame with sequential subcategory IDs and subcategory titles.
- Export the DataFrame as `subcategory.csv`.

### 3. Campaign DataFrame

- Create a DataFrame with necessary columns as per the instructions.
- Export the DataFrame as `campaign.csv`.

### 4. Contacts DataFrame

- Create a DataFrame with contact details.
- Export the DataFrame as `contacts.csv`.

### 5. Crowdfunding Database

- Design a table schema based on the provided ERD.
- Create a PostgreSQL database and import CSV data into the appropriate tables.
- Verify data integrity by querying each table.
